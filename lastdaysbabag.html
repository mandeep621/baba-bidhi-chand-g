    <p style="font-size: 25px;color: black;">Bhai Bidhi chand took active part in all these wars. In peaceful times Bhai Bidhi Chand was a preacher. Bhai Bidhi Chand was a close friend of Sundar Shah, a follower of Sanee Budhan Shah. Sundar Shah was a resident of Deo Nagar, near Ayoudhia. Sundar Shah and Bidhi Chand wished that they should leave this world at the same time and place. In 1638, Sundar Shah came to have a glimpse of the Guru at Kirat pur and asked Bhai Bidhi Chand to come along.

        Along with Sundar Shah, Bhai Bidhi Chand took his leave from Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji and went to Deonagar. The two friends spent three days reflecting together on the teaching of Guru Nanak, whereafter, both died at the same time (14 August 1640). Sundar Shah's disciples buried the one in accordance with muslim rites and cremated the other in accordance with Sikh rites, and raised shrines in their honour. Some time later, Lal Chand, a nephew of Bhai Bidhi Chand, brought some earth from the site of his shrine at Deonagar over which he built a samadh in his ancestral village, Sursingh.
