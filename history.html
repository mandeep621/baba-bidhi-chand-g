    <p>Gurudwara Sri Bhath Sahib is situated in Patti district Tarn Taran. Sangat from lahore side was bringing dushale (shawls) for Sri Guru HarGobind Sahib ji. But the mughals had taken those forcefully. When sangat reached Bhai ki Daroli, they told Guru Sahib whole story. Guru Sahib said that now those dushales belonged to him and he will himself get them back. Guru Sahib appointed Bhai bidi chand ji to bring back the dushales. Bhai Bidhi Chand ji reached Patti city. Patti in those days main trading center. Dressed as women Bhai Sahib reached hakims residence and showed them few dushales he was carrying along with him. Hakims asked there ladies to show him the dushales which they had stolen from sangat to get them evaluated. When they showed the dushales Bhai bidi chand ji took dushales from them and ran away. In the mean time hakim got all the doors closed of patti city. And started searching each and every house of patti. Bhai Sahib reached a Bhathi and asked him for some place to hide. That person showed Bhai Sahib the Bhathi where fire was going on. Bhai Sahib sat there in Bhathi. On other side Guru Sahib started asked to pour water on him as his Singh was sitting on fire. With blessing of Guru Sahib there was no harm to Bhai Bidhi Chand ji.</p> 

    <p> Once a large Sangat (a group of devotees) carrying costly Dushallas (blankets decorated with precious stones) was passing through Patti City, to have a glimpse of Sixth Sikh Guru, Shri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. They wanted to offer these Dushallas to Guru Ji to pay respect to him. Suddenly it started raining and all the Dushalas got wet. The devotees spread the Dushallas for drying up in Badami Bag of Patti. The Mughal king of Patti came to know about these costly Dushallas and he forcibly snatched Dushallas from the devotees. The devotees, however, succeeded in hiding one Dushalla. When they reached the Darbar of Guru Ji , they presented one Dushalla to Guru Ji and told him what had happened at Patti. Guru Ji pacified them. Baba Biddhi Chand, who was earlier a robber of the area but had now become a follower of Guru Ji , was sitting there. He could not tolerate and vowed to recover the Dushallas. He after taking permission of Guru Ji went to Patti in the attire of a businessman. The Mughals showed him snatched Dushallas for sale. Baba Biddhi Chand wore a burqa (a clothing worn by Muslim women to almost completely cover themselves) and entered the harm and took away Dushallas and gold Jewellery. The ruler of Patti , upon hearing of the theft, ordered to close all the four doors of Patti and to find the thief. When Bhai Biddhi Chand could not find a place to hide except for a Tandoor (an Oven) run by an old man, he entered the hot Oven alongwith the stolen goods. After sometime he came out of the Oven, but to his surprise he and the Dushallas were safe, only the gold stolen against Guru Ji's orders had melted. Bhai Biddhi Chand escaped out of the City and reached the Darbar of Guru Ji. Guru Ji was very pleased and gave him a Siropa (a turban). Gurdwara Shri Batth Sahib Baba Biddhi Chand is situated at the place where the hot Tandoor once existed.</p>
