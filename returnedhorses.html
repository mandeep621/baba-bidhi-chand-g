    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Bhai Bidhi Chand Returned back the Horses</h1>
    
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Once devotees of Kabul came to see the Guru. One person Karori Mal was accompanying them. He had brought with him two horses of good breed named Gulbagh and Dilbagh to present to the Guru.

        When the congregation reached Lahore the administrator of Lahore Anait-Ullah Saw these horses. Anaith – Ullah wanted to buy those horses, but karori mal refused and said,”I have not brought these borses to sell but i want to present these to my lord, Guru Hargobind Sahib.” Anait-Ullah was enraged to hear it and he snatched the horses by force. When devotees met the Guru, They presented the girts they had brought. But Karor Mal instead of offering any gift said, “My lord! I had Brought two horses of good breed Named Gulbagh and Dilbagh to present to you. But the administrator of Lahore Anait-Ullah Snatched them from me by force. Now I am very unfortunate that I Cannot offer you any gift. ” Hearing this the Guru Laughed and said,”karori Mal! Don’t Worry, We have received your horses. They will not remain with Anait- Ullah for long, I am very pleased that you have brought such a valugable gift. One Day you will find your horses enriching our stable.”
        
        Bhai Karori Mal was satisfied and felft Happy.
        
        Next Day the Guru Sent for Bhai Bidhi Chand. The Guru Sent him to Lahore to bring back the horses. Bidhi Chand reached Lahore and stayed in the house of Bhai Jiwan. Next day he disguised himself as a grass-cutter. He went to the fields and cut a bundle of the fine grass and bringing it to Lahore sat at the Gate of the fort. The horse-Keeper Said Khan when came outside he was pleased to see such a fine grass and bought it from Bidhi Chand. Bidhi Chand put the bundle on his head and went towards the stable. Said khan asked Bidhi Chand to distribute the grass to the Horses. Bidhi Chand was throwing the grass in front of the horses and also was pating on their back amicably.
        
        Bidhi Chand used to bring the grass daily and with the permission of Said Khan Distributed it to the Horses. Due to such Amicable service the horses became friends of Bidhi Chand. They were now recognising him and even were neighing at the very sight of Bidhi Chand. Said Khan when saw such love of Bidhi Chand he appointed him a servant of the horses. Bidhi Chand himself was leading a very simple life but was increasing his affection for the horses.
        
        The river Ravi was touching the wall of the fort on one side. Bidhi Chand used to throw one big stone in the river at night. When the watchmen heard the sound of the stone, they were alarmed, but when they looked towards the river, they did not see anything. At last hey thought that some animal was striking the wall and they did not care for that sound again. Bidhi Chand was feasting the watchmen withi his salary. They were very pleased with him. When Bidhi Chand got the next salary he gave a grand feast to the watchmen. He also served them wine and made them unconscious. Bidhi Chand shut them in their room. Then he searched and found the keys and untied the horse name Gulbagh and riding on it jumped of the wall of the fort and fell into the river. The other watchmen when heard the noise at same time this night they did not care this and thought that again this is some animal making the noise. After crossing the river Bidhi Chand struck the horse with his heel and Gulbagh ran as fast as he could. Next Day Bidhi Chand presented the horse to the Guru.  The Guru was very pleased to see such a feat of Bidhi Chand. He got up and clasped Bidhi Chand with the great love.
        
        In order to Bring the second horse named Dilbagh, Bidhi Chand disguised himself as an Astrologer. When he presented the second horse to the Guru, he patted at his back with great love and Blessed him saying:</p>
