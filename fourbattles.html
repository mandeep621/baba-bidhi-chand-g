    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Role in Four Crucial Battles</h1>
    <p>Muslims of the Mughal clans were rulers. The Pathans and other clans were neither satisfied nor happy at their rule. Hundreds of hindus and muslims came to the alter of the Guru. Subedaar Yaar Khan and Foujdaar Khawaja Sarai are worth mentioning. Guru Sahib had small group of organised soldiers with him. He wanted his Sikhs to learn and practice martial art. Whenever there was a call for war by the Mughals, out of shear love for the Guru, the Sikhs came to the Guru with their weapons, from all sides of Punjab as well as Kashmir. The Guru divided his army into five groups. Bhai Bidhi Chand was the commander of one such group. His main work was that of intelligence and vigilance. He kept a watch on the movements of the Mughal forces.</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 25px;">1st Battle:</h1><p> The first war took place at Pipli Sahib in Amritsar in May 1628. The Battle of Amritsar started with the capture of a rare white Baz (hawk) which had been a gift to Shah Jahan from the Emperor of Persia. (The Hawk was at the time one of the royal symbols of authority). On Vaisaki a party of Shah Jahan's troops were hunting in a royal private reserve near Gumtala village near Amritsar at the same time as some of the Guru's Sikhs.</p>
<p>The Guru's hawk downed a special, rare white hawk that had been a gift of the Shah of Persia. The Sikhs had picked up and tethered the white hawk unaware that it belonged to the emperor. The mughal troops, no doubt in a panic had seen the hawk fall and came looking for the Emperors prized Baz.</p>
<p>The mughals are said to have used some derogatory language towards the Sikhs who refused to return the hawk and this soon escalated into a small violent conflict between the two parties with the mughals leaving the fight. Reports were soon made to the Court explaining, no doubt that the Sikhs were hostile and superior in numbers as well. Soon officials of the emperor sought the return of the valued gift from the Guru who it is said, refused to return the hawk as Guru Ji replied that the Hawk had come to the Guru with his own wish and couldn't be returned, because that which had come into the protection (sharan) of the Guru. When this news spread, the local people hostile to the Guru started backbiting and encouraged Shah Jahan (the Emperor) to "teach" the Guru who was the leader.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan ordered Gulam Rasool Khan of Lahore to capture and produce the Guru and the falcon. About 700 Sikhs led by Bhai Bidhi Chand, Praana, Jetha, Pairha and Pandhe Khan faced the Mughal army of 7000 soldiers. The Mughal forces ran away after the death of Gulam Rasool Khan and other 2 commanders and the Guru came out victorious.</p>
<p>Angered at his defeat, Shah Jahan immediately ordered for another attack. Just after 10 days the Subedar of Kashmir, Muklas Khan, and other commanders like Bahadur Khan, Kalandar Khan, Mirza Tahar Beg, Kale Khan, Shams Khan with 15000 soldiers attacked Amritsar. Bhai Bidhi Chand, Bhallan, Jattu, Painde Khan along with about 5000 Sikhs were with the Guru. The Sikh army took shelter in the fort Loh Garh, at Amritsar. It was first time, a cannon made out of a hollow trunk of a tree was used by the Sikh army. After a wall of the fort was damaged by the cannons of the Mughal forces, the Sikhs came out in open. The fight spread in the city of Amritsar and the city was looted by the Mughals. The Sikhs of various villages from all sides started rushing to the city with their weapons. The Guru himself took part in the fight. Mukhlas Khan challanged the Guru to face him. He lost his life at the hands of the Guru and thus the field was in the hands of Sikhs. Five Mughal generals and on the Guru's side Bhai Bhana, Baga, Sobha, Bhagan, Dhama Chand gave away their lives.</p>
<p>It was the time of marriage of Bibi Veero, Guru Ji's daughter. Within this war time Guru Sahib's family was shifted to Jhabaal, a village South- East of Amritsar and next day marriage was conducted.</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 25px;">2nd Battle:</h1>
<p>After the marriage of his daughter and the war at Amritsar, Guru Sahib came to Kartarpur and then moved to Hargobind Pura. Hargobind Pura was founded by Guru Arjan Sahib Ji in the name of his son Hargobind. In 1630, Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji went to this place to make a protective wall around the town. While looking at the bad relations between the Guru and Shah Jahan and taking advantage of this Bhagwan Chand Khatri, a close relative of Dewaan Chandu and tax collector for the Mughals, warned the Guru and the Sikhs to go away from there. Daily one after the other day he started coming and abusing Sikhs as well as Sikh Gurus. Even beating by Sikhs could not stop his abuses. Ultimately he was beaten to death. His son Ratan Chand, sons of Chandu, and Meharban a cousin of Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji and son of Prithi Chand, instigated Abdulla Khan, Subedar of Jallandar to attack the Guru at Hargobind Pura. Without consent of Shah Jahan, Abdulla Khan, along with eight commanders and the Khatri enemies of the guru with about 20000 soldiers attacked the forces of the Guru. Ratan Chand , Karam chand and Abdulla khan came face to face with Guru Sahib. Guru Sahib fought with all the three and killed them one after the other.</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 25px;">3rd Battle:</h1>
<p>After Bhai Bidhi Chand had recovered Guru's horses from Lahore, a third war took place in 1631 at Mehraj, near Nathane ki Dhab, now called Guru Sar. Lalla Beg and Kammar Beg with about 20000 soldiers challenged the Guru's forces. After severe fight when Lalla Beg was killed, the Mughal forces took to their heels.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 25px;">4th Battle:</h1>
<p>Painde Khan was brought up by the Guru since his childhood and he bravely took part in the wars by the side of the guru. In 1632, at the instigation of his relatives, other muslim enemies of the Guru and of his own ego of strength and power, he revolted and became enemy of the guru. Even Dhir Mall, son of Baba Gurditta joined the Mughal forces and was traitor to his father and grand father Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. Thus Kale Khan commander of Jalandhar, Painde Khan, Dhir Mall and the like Khatries challanged the Sikhs at Kartarpur. Bhai Bidhi Chand, Baba Gurditta, young Tegh Bahadur (the future 9th Guru at that time) took part in the war. In the field, at the hands of Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji, his mentor, Painde Khan was fatally injured. Lying injured at the feet of the Guru, he asked for his forgiveness, the Guru blessed him and reminded him to read Kalma, the muslim way of prayer before departing.</p>
<p>Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji, in his heart was a symbol of peace and full of patience but outwardly he was a king, a true king (Sacha Patshah) full of valor, strength and power. He was very regular in listening Gurbani and Kirtan and explaining true meanings of Gurbani to the Sadh Sangat (congregation). While writing about the Guru in a field of war a muslim historian Mohsin Fani writes that even in war field, he was a Guru. He was never first in attacking the enemy, in fact no body was his enemy, but who so ever challenged him to fight, he gave them full opportunity for attack, of course he was fully alert to protect himself and then he would caution and attack and at the same time advise how to use the weapon, and with his skill, kill the attacker. It was this enormous patience and strength that he was always victorious in war.</p>
